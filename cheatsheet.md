# Cuttle Cheat Sheet

## Goal

Be the first to accumulate 21 or more points worth of point cards.

## Setup

Decide which player will take the first turn. This player is dealt a hand of 5
cards, and the other player is dealt a hand of 6 cards.

## On each turn

On each turn, you may do **one** of the following:

- Draw a card
- Play a card
- Pass (only if the draw pile runs out)

## Point cards

- Aces are worth 1 point
- Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value
- Jack, Queen, and King are not point cards

## Scuttles

- To scuttle, your card must have a higher point value
- Or, it may have the same point value, but a higher suit
- The suit rank is ♣️ < ♦️ < ♥️ < ♠️
