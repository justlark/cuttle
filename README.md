# Cuttle: A combat card game

Cuttle is a combat card game for two players. It's played with a standard
52-card deck without any jokers.

This repo documents the rules of Cuttle and also provides a cheatsheet for
quick reference during play.

This rulebook was adapted from [this
page](https://www.pagat.com/combat/cuttle.html), which was adapted from Richard
Sipie's [cuttle FAQ](https://www.geocities.ws/richardsipie/cuttle.htm).

These rules are typeset using [Typst](https://typst.app/) and are designed to
be printable. To compile them to a PDF:

1. [Install Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
2. Make sure you have the `Twitter Color Emoji` and `Noto Sans` fonts installed.
3. Run `typst compile rules.typ` and `typst compile cheatsheet.typ`.

The documents are compiled to PDF automatically on each push via a [CI
workflow](https://github.com/justlark/cuttle/actions/workflows/render.yaml).
